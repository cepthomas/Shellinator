# Shellinator
Playing with shell extensions to provide some custom context menus.

Consists of a simple command line client that is called from registry commands. It executes the requested operation.
It is also used to configure registry commands, and some other stuff.

This is not currently a general purpose tool but rather a personal collection of specific customizations.
To make your own, copy and hack away using VS2022 and .NET8.
